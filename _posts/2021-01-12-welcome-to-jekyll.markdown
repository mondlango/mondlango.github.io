**[mondlango.github.io](https://mondlango.github.io/)** is a website that want to present the constructed language Mondlango in a simple way, in English, Chinese and Mondlango.

I hope this website to be cooperative, and you can edit each page of this website in a simple way here: [github.com/mondlango/mondlango.github.io/tree/main/pages](https://github.com/mondlango/mondlango.github.io/tree/main/pages).

Another goal of this webiste is to present the future activities of [https://github.com/mondlango/](https://github.com/mondlango/): a place to create a workable documentation for the Mondlango constructed language. And a place to keep another backup of the old website **www.mondlango.com** than is currently only backed up on [www.heyafu.org](http://www.heyafu.org/english/).
